# HW3_passwordGenerator
Create arrays for: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers.
Create function that sets password length from 8 to 128 characters long, and create a prompt for user to input their desired length.
Add confirm functions to ask user if they would like uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. 
Create conditionals depending on the user's answers on confirm functions of each variable and input that in the console.
Make sure that random characters are generated per user's choice (if they choose "ok" or "cancel" on uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters).
After user selects their prompts the password is displayed on the card on webpage.
Create an event listener on the generate password button so the process can repeat each time the user clicks on it.
